# Venue

We will welcome you on Sunday around 18:00h for a welcome buffet at the main site. The main idea of this pre-course meeting is to meet each other in an informal environment.

Please note: there will be food and drinks to satisfy your hunger and thirst, and usually we move on into the town in smaller groups to enjoy the many beer gardens and restaurants.
