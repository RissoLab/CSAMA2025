# Overview

The one-week intensive summer school **Biological Data Science** teaches advanced computational analyses of modern molecular data types in biology and biomedicine, including single cell and spatial omics. It comprises lectures covering underlying theory and concepts, practical hands-on exercises, and informal discussion sessions. Lecture topics include modern biotechnologies for quantitative measurements, statistical analysis, visualisation, and computational tools. Hands-on exercises are looking at state-of-the-art datasets, using the R / Bioconductor environment. At the end of the course, you should be better able to design, implement and interpret analyses on your own (multi-)omic, single and/or spatial data, adapt and combine different tools, and make informed and scientifically sound choices about analysis strategies.
